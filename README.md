# My List 

Welcome to the My List live link [My List](https://marceillo.github.io/my-list/).

This is a list for people to add to do tasks or any other item they would like to add for example a grocery list or any idea they wish to add. The name My List was chosen to be a functional tool to help with daily life and tasks. It's a plain, simple list with little distractions or images in the body. You can add items mark them as completed and delete them when needed.

# User Experience

## Wireframes

![Wireframe](assets/images/wireframe.png)

## Site Structure

- The site has a basic HTML structure  with a heading.
- Below the heading is an input section and a button to add text.
- Once the text is added, the user can check and delete the task.
- The focus was on the JavaScript code to create functionality for the site.
  
## Design Choices

- The idea is to make the list minimalist to improve the user's thought process.
- The list below has a checked button and a delete button to add some user functionality.

## Colour Scheme  

- A two-tone color pallet was used for this site.
- The buttons have the same colors and are inverted to improve visibility.
  
## Features

### Existing Features

- Favicon is a picture of a list to indicate this is a to-do list.
- Input text
- Add Button
  
#### Javascript adding new tasks to the list. 

 - Java script function to add the task on the page and to local storage.
   
    ![Add a task](assets/images/input-add-button.png)
   
 - The input field has a delete button and a checked button that removes items from the list
   
   ![Delet and check button](assets/images/checked-display2.png)
   
 - Function for deleting in JS was also set to remove from Local Storage with the delete trashcan button.
 - The checked button has a line through once checked 
 
##### Delete trashcan  Button  
 
 - The delete button has a hover style function to indicate to the user they are clicking on it.
 - This button removes the item from the list the user no longer needs and from local storage as well.
 
 ##### Checked  Button

- When this button is checked, a line through function is created in Java script to indicate that the task has been completed to the end user.
- The second feature is to update the to-list that the button has been checked and to keep it saved in that format.

#### Inspiration

- I like to use a to-do list daily as it is a functional tool.
- I like using apps daily such as Google Keep.
  
#### Future Features
I would have liked to add more functionality to the list so that the user has more control such as below.

 - Function to change the color schemes.
 - Able to edit the list after adding it as a task.
 - Able to import pictures to their tasks.
 - Able to archive their tasks.
 - Different windows for different tasks.
 - Alert function

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so itâ€™s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used â€˜image1.pngâ€™ consider naming it â€˜landing_page_img.pngâ€™. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
